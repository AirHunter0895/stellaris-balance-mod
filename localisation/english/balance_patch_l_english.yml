 # Events
 shattered.2.name:0 "Megastructural Engineering Breakthrough"
 shattered.2.desc:0 "It is no secret that [Root.GetName] is badly damaged. Its millenia spent without maintenance have taken a toll on its generator, and The Interloper has severely threatened its structural integrity. It is frankly remarkable that the ringworld has not been rendered entirely uninhabitable by now.\n\nHowever, recent developments in the fields of engineering have given rise to new theories of how this damage could be reversed. Our brightest minds suggest that with enough time and alloys, we could potentially return the shattered ringworld to its former flory. They need only your authorisation for the project."
 shattered.3.name:0 "Ringworld Reparation Project"
 shattered.3.desc:0 "Our engineers have returned with a finished proposal for the reparation of [Root.GetName]. Through a reinforcement of alloys at several key points across the shattered ringworld, they believe they can safeguard against future structural damage and systems failures. Though this will be a costly and time-consuming process, they insist that it is merely the first step in restoring the megastructure to its former glory."
 shattered.6.name:0 "Megastructural Engineering Breakthrough"
 shattered.6.desc:0 "Our top engineers have once again taken an interest in [Root.GetName]. Though its most significant structural and technical issues have been resolved through prior maintenance, there are still a number of improvements that could be made to the megastructure's integrity. Our scientists believe that with their current level of expertise, it should be possible to reinforce the shattered ringworld and return it to 100% efficiency. You need only give the order."
 shattered.7.name:0 "Ringworld Restoration Project"
 shattered.7.desc:0 "It is done; the preparations are complete. We are on the cusp of returning the shattered ringworld to its proper glory. Once we have allocated the requisite alloys and manpower to the project, our work will be all but finished."
 spbm.2.name:0 "Crime Wave Subsides on [Root.GetName]!"
