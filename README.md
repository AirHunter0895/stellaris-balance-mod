# Stellaris Balance Mod
Praise the Birb, and the Birb shalth give a perfectly balanced game. Balance changes can be viewed in the GitHub wiki.

## Installation

 - Clone the master branch to `C:/Users/{YOUR_USER}/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod` - cloning is important since then you will be able to also update it through Git (I recommend doing this through an app like GitHub Desktop)
 - Make sure the folder is named "stellaris-balance-mod" and if it isn't- rename it to that.
 - Move the `stellaris-balance-patch.mod` file from the `stellaris-balance-patch` folder out into the mod folder.
 - Everything should work now. Go to the Launcher, and look at Mods- if you want "Stellaris Balance Mod" with a hard drive icon next to it, you have done everything right.
